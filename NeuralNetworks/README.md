# Neural Network Back Propagation

This example is based off the problem presented in :

https://hmkcode.com/ai/backpropagation-step-by-step/

Also, this particular implementation is done without any machine learning libraries.

The NN has:

1. Two inputs: 2 and 3
2. One output: 2
3. Two layers with 6 weights:
   
   3.1 layer 1: .11 .21 .12 .08
   
   3.2 layer 2: .14 .15


This is a python implementation.

The file [nn-backpropagation-manual-step-by-step.py](nn-backpropagation-manual-step-by-step.py) is a step-by-step manual example.

The file [nn-backpropagation.py](nn-backpropagation.py) is an implementation with parameters that allow for searching optimal weights.
